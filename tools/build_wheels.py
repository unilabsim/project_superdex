"""Build every published SuperDex wheel into one wheelhouse.

    uv run tools/build_wheels.py --output wheelhouse           # publishable wheels
    uv run tools/build_wheels.py --output wheelhouse --fast    # iterating
    uv run tools/check_wheels.py wheelhouse

Run from the repository root.

The default path builds the seven native distributions with `cibuildwheel` and the two pure
ones with `python -m build`. That is the one that produces publishable artifacts: correct
platform tags, and the per-platform wheel repair.

`--fast` trades that away for iteration speed -- see `build_fast`.

`--host` is for macOS and Windows environments where cibuildwheel cannot provision its own
interpreter. On macOS that step writes into `/Library/Frameworks` through `sudo installer`;
on Windows it downloads CPython through nuget. `--host` builds with the interpreter it is
handed but still applies each pyproject's `repair-wheel-command`, so the wheels stay
publishable -- see `build_host`.

This script holds no build configuration. Every knob -- Python versions, CMake arguments,
repair commands, repair exclusions -- lives in each distribution's `pyproject.toml`, so a
CI workflow that shells out to the same `cibuildwheel` command cannot drift away from what
is built locally. What lives here is the list of distributions, and the local-machine
plumbing (container engine selection) that has no business being checked in.
