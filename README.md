# Project SuperDex

> A unified platform for dexterous manipulation research

**Welcome to Project SuperDex.**

SuperDex brings together a purpose-built physics engine, robotics authoring
tools, and a scalable reinforcement learning interface in a unified simulation
platform, with VR-based teleoperation and additional capabilities planned for
future releases.

## Building blocks

- **SuperDex Physics** — A contact-first physics engine purpose-built for tactile
  manipulation, and applicable wherever stable contact and accurate sensing
  matter. This is the simulation backbone of Project SuperDex.
- **SuperDex Robotics** — A robotics SDK that provides robot definitions and
  composition, controllers, sensors, actuators, and the framework that
  aggregates them into complete simulation configs.
- **SuperDex Studio** — A lightweight desktop GUI authoring and visualization
  application for creating, editing, and validating the simulation assets —
  robots, meshes, task prefabs, and scenes.
- **SuperDex Lab** — The simulation harness that abstracts the Markov decision
  process and dynamics-constrained-optimization underpinning RL, MPC, and
  system-ID.

## Q4 2026: SuperDex Teleop

SuperDex Teleop is the next major module coming to Project SuperDex. Initial components for Unreal Engine 5 based virtual teleoperation will be available in Q4 2026.

![Ben Virtual Teleop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08a742a1-b7e5-4f77-a69a-8e24a761048e)

SuperDex Teleop runs natively on-device on Quest 3. No remote PC, no streaming. Includes support for both hand tracking and controllers including mixed mode. Runs in pure C++ for low-latency, real-time, scalable virtual teleop.

## Requirements
* **OS:** Linux (x86_64), Windows (x86_64), macOS (ARM)
* **Python:** Standard (GIL-enabled) CPython 3.12 or newer
   - Native binding wheels use the stable `abi3` ABI from Python 3.12 onward.

## Get the Source Code and Examples

* Clone: `git clone --branch stable https://github.com/facebookresearch/project_superdex.git`
    * Note: `stable` branch always matches latest published release

## Quick Start (Python)

Project SuperDex has first-class support for Python across the board. The quickest way to get started is with `uv` and `pypi` wheels.

1. Install pre-requisites
    * [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    * Linux Only: `SuperDex Studio` and `SuperDex Physics Debugger` require an available X11 display (native X11 or XWayland), a graphics driver supporting OpenGL 4.1, and the following runtime components:
       * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libgl1 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxext6 libxrandr2 libxinerama1 libxcursor1 libxi6 zenity`
       * Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install libglvnd-glx libX11 libX11-xcb libxcb libXext libXrandr libXinerama libXcursor libXi zenity`
2. `cd` into the `project_superdex` source directory
3. Create venv `uv venv`
4. Pip Install: `uv pip install superdex`
5. Run
    * Optional: To run Python examples in FP64, set the environment variable `SUPERDEX_PRECISION=fp64`; otherwise, FP32 is used.
    * Physics example: `uv run superdex_physics/examples/example_tendon_comparison.py`
    * Robotics example: `uv run superdex_robotics/examples/control/example_osc_jsc_control.py`
    * SuperDex Studio: `uv run superdex-studio`

## Building from Source

### Install Pre-requisites

* For Python build:
    * [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
* For C++ build:
    * [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (v3.26 or newer)
    * [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)
* Linux:
    * [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) (v17 or newer):
        * Check your installed version: `clang --version`. The executable may be versioned instead (for example, `clang-22 --version`).
        * If needed, install Clang:
            * Ubuntu/Debian: Install Clang 22 from the [official LLVM repository](https://apt.llvm.org/):
                ```bash
                wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
                chmod +x llvm.sh
                sudo ./llvm.sh 22
                ```
            * Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install clang`
    * Before building, set `CC` and `CXX` to the Clang executables you verified above so CMake uses them.
        Choose one:

        ```bash
        # Unversioned executables
        export CC=clang
        export CXX=clang++
        ```

        ```bash
        # Versioned executables: set this to your installed major version (17 or newer)
        CLANG_VERSION=22
        export CC="clang-${CLANG_VERSION}"
        export CXX="clang++-${CLANG_VERSION}"
        ```
        NOTE: If CMake already configured the build directory with different compilers, delete the build directory before trying again because CMake caches its compiler selection.
    * **SuperDex Studio** and **SuperDex Physics Debugger** source builds (`uv sync --extra gui`) additionally require:
        * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxcb1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`
        * Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install libX11-devel libXext-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel libxcb-devel mesa-libGL-devel`
* macOS:
    * Install **Xcode Command Line Tools** for Xcode 26 or newer: `xcode-select --install`
    * Check "Software Update" for the latest version if already installed.
* Windows:
    * [MSVC Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) for VS2022 or newer (Visual Studio IDE is not necessary)
        * Select the **Desktop development with C++** workload and include the **C++ Clang tools for Windows** (ClangCL) component.
    * Or install from terminal:
        * `winget install --exact --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Llvm.Clang --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Llvm.ClangToolset --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows11SDK.26100"`
* Ensure `uv` and the platform-specific Clang compiler are on PATH for Python builds: `clang` and `clang++` on Linux/macOS (versioned names such as `clang-17` and `clang++-17` are also supported), or `clang-cl` on Windows. For C++ builds, also ensure `cmake` and `ninja` are on PATH.
* Other compilers such as GCC and MSVC are not officially supported or covered by CI, but can be used "at your own risk".

### Building from Source (Python)

1. Get the source code and install pre-requisites (see above)
2. Windows only: From the Start menu, launch the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` matching your installed Visual Studio version (e.g. `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022`).
3. `cd` into the `project_superdex` source directory; `uv sync` must be run from this repository root
4. Build: `uv sync --extra gui -v`
5. Run:
    * Physics example: `uv run superdex_physics/examples/example_tendon_comparison.py`
    * Robotics example: `uv run superdex_robotics/examples/control/example_osc_jsc_control.py`
    * SuperDex Studio: `uv run superdex-studio`

Flags for `uv sync` are:

| uv sync flags (additive) | Build targets |
| :-- | :-- |
| `--extra build` | build tools only |
| `--extra core` | physics, robotics, lab |
| `--extra gui` | core + physics-debugger, studio, mesh-cli |
| `--extra fp64` | core + physics-fp64, robotics-fp64 |
| `--all-extras` | everything |

NOTE: Running the examples above requires `--extra gui`.

NOTE: `--extra fp64` builds the FP64 bindings, but FP32 is still the default at runtime. To run Python examples in FP64, set the environment variable `SUPERDEX_PRECISION=fp64`.

### Building from Source (C++)

Core modules such as SuperDex Physics and SuperDex Robotics are written in C++ and exposed to Python. Full C++ examples will be shared in the future. Users who are interested in calling C++ directly can get started via `CMake`.

1. Get the source code and install pre-requisites (see above)
2. Windows only: From the Start menu, launch the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` matching your installed Visual Studio version (e.g. `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022`).
3. `cd` into the `project_superdex` source directory
4. Configure lean Release build: `cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMOCHI_BUILD_DEBUGGER=OFF -DMOCHI_USE_PYBIND=OFF -G Ninja`
5. Build: `cmake --build build --parallel`

NOTE: To build the C++ libraries in FP64, add `-DMOCHI_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=ON` when configuring CMake. Otherwise, FP32 will be used by default.
