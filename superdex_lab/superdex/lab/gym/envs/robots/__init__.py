"""Robot environments.

Environments here are registered explicitly with Gymnasium by
:mod:`superdex.lab.gym.registration`; this package intentionally has no import-time side
effects. Import concrete classes from their own modules rather than from this package,
which re-exports nothing.

Which env modules are present depends on the build, so this package can legitimately be
empty.
