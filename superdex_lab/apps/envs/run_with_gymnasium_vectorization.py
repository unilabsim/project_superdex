SuperDex Gym environments currently do not support native vectorization, meaning they can
only run one simulation scene at a time. While this is sufficient for inference, policy
training often requires running multiple environments in parallel to accelerate data
collection.

To address this limitation, our training scripts utilize Ray's capabilities for
transparent and efficient vectorization. However, this approach may not be suitable for
all users, as it is library-specific and deeply integrated within RLlib's training
framework.

An alternative is to use environment vectorization wrappers. These wrappers allow us to
run multiple environments in parallel while maintaining a consistent interface with the
original environments. They also handle packing and unpacking of observations and
actions to and from the main process, enabling interaction with the environments as if
they were running in the main process.

In this script, we demonstrate how to use one of these wrappers with SuperDex Gym
environments. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of our `HybridVectorEnv` wrapper,
which combines Gymnasium's AsyncVectorEnv and SyncVectorEnv to enable vectorized
environment execution. This hybrid approach balances parallelism with efficiency by
reducing process communication overhead while still leveraging multiple cores.

Note: This wrapper is provided for convenience. For more advanced use cases or different
vectorization strategies, consider using Gymnasium's native wrappers directly:
- AsyncVectorEnv: https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/vector/async_vector_env/
- SyncVectorEnv: https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/vector/sync_vector_env/
