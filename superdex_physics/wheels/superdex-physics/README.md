# SuperDex Physics

[SuperDex Physics](https://facebookresearch.github.io/project_superdex/physics/) is a
contact-first physics engine purpose-built for tactile manipulation, and applicable wherever
stable contact and accurate sensing matter. This is the simulation backbone of Project
SuperDex.

Provides the `superdex.physics` package: the physics simulation runtime, the viewer, and
the scene/asset utilities.

The published wheel does not carry the debugger GUI client or the mesh CLI helper, so
`superdex.physics.debugger` and `superdex.physics.mesh` are unavailable unless you build
from source. Remote debugging still works: `DebugServer` is part of the core runtime.

```bash
pip install superdex-physics
```

This wheel carries the FP32 native extension. For FP64, install the `fp64` extra -- which
pulls in `superdex-physics-fp64` -- and select it at import time:

```bash
pip install 'superdex-physics[fp64]'
export SUPERDEX_PRECISION=fp64
```
