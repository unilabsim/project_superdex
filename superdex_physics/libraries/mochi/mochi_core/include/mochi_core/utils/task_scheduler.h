  Profiling

  The TaskScheduler is designed to handle a huge number of tiny tasks. As such, it is possible for
  the overhead of detailed profile scopes to adversely affect performance when the profiling tool is
  connected. This may lead to incorrect conclusions about the efficiency of concurrent algorithms,
  so you can adjust the verbosity as needed.

    MOCHI_TASK_PROFILE_VERBOSITY_NONE:
      Zero overhead. Zero info unless the task has its own profile scopes.

    MOCHI_TASK_PROFILE_VERBOSITY_LOW:
      All tasks will have the label "RunTask" to ensure that they are visible in the tool.
      There will be no way to tell which task it was unless the task has its own profile scopes.

    MOCHI_TASK_PROFILE_VERBOSITY_HIGH:
      Every task will have a descriptive label in the form "RunTask NAME (ID)". The name lets you
      know what it is and the ID lets you match it to the corresponding "AddTask NAME (ID)" scope.
      This is nice for debugging but significantly degrades performance when the profiling tool is
      connected.
